# Stack-of-Scopes-with-robust-testing-C++-

Created abstraction of Stack using deque data structure that contained scope.
Each scope encapculated name of the scope (function) and a map, where map had a name of the variables as a key and type of it as a value in that particular scope.

Created testing files to cover all edge cases using C++ CATCH framework.
